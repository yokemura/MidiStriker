# MidiStriker
MIDI to Key Stroke Converter.

Since [MIDIStroke](https://github.com/charlieroberts/midiStroke) is discontinued while it won't work with newer macOS, I needed another solution to convert MIDI signal to key stroke.
I tried to fork and update MIDIStroke but its Objective-C code is too old and it will require the same amount of work as writing it from scratch.
On top of that the UI of MIDIStroke didn't fit my usage, and then here's this repository.

# WIP
This project is still in progress, but it still might work for specific people, who are
- able to build this Xcode project
- not changing key mapping often
- not using conbinations with modifier keys
